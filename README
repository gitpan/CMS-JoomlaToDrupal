CMS-JoomlaToDrupal

This module is to fulfill a growing need I've had to support
clients migrating from Joomla to Drupal.

It permits one to migrate existing authors (as users), stories,
comments and the relationships amongs them from a legacy joomla
site to a new installation of a drupal site.

It was developed and successfully used to migrate 
	http://blackagendareports.com/

including over 1000 stories and 10,000 comments accumulated
on the legacy site.  Their support for its development is
appreciated.
